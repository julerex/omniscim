# Omniscim

Persistent world MMO sandbox scientific social simulation game

- Open source
- Built on Godot Engine
- One hour in-game lasts one minute real-world
- Game rules are reality-centric
- Low-poly 3D graphics
- Graphical realism and animation are a secondary concern 
- The ability of the player to control their avatar is dependent on the avatar's emotional state, like `The Sims` but perhaps to a greater extent
